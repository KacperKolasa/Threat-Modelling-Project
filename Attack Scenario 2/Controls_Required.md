**Controls Required:**

- API Security Audits to identify vulnerabilities in the machine processes and ensure API endpoints are secure.

- Input Validation and Sanitization to prevent exploits like SQL injection or command injection within automation workflows.

- Access Control on Data Lakes to restrict who can read, write, and modify sensitive data stored in the data lake.

- Rate Limiting on API requests to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting machine processes.

- Data Encryption for data at rest and in transit within the data lake to prevent unauthorized access.

- Regular Penetration Testing to simulate attacks on the machine processes and data lake, identifying potential vulnerabilities.

- Automated Workflow Monitoring to detect anomalies in machine processes, such as irregular or malicious automation tasks.

- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing critical backend and data lake functions to prevent unauthorized admin access.

- Comprehensive API Logging to ensure all interactions with machine processes are traceable and auditable.
